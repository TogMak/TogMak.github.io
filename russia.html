		 <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy emerged from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th centuries) and gradually conquered and absorbed surrounding principalities. In the early 17th century, a new ROMANOV dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (<time datetime="1682">1682</time>-<time datetime="1725">1725</time>), hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia.</p>

            <p>Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of <time datetime="1904">1904</time>-05 contributed to the Revolution of <time datetime="1905">1905</time>, which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Devastating defeats and food shortages in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow of the ROMANOV Dynasty in <time datetime="1917">1917</time>. The communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).</p>
