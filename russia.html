            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>The Principality of Muscovy emerged in the 12th century after 200 years of Mongol domination, eventually expanding and absorbing surrounding regions. In the early 17th century, the <abbr title="Romanov">ROMANOV</abbr> dynasty continued this expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under <abbr title="Peter the Great">Peter I</abbr> (1682-1725), Russia extended its influence to the Baltic Sea and was renamed the Russian Empire.</p>

                <p>During the 19th century, Russia acquired more territories in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (<time datetime="1904">1904</time>-<time datetime="1905">1905</time>) sparked the Revolution of <time datetime="1905">1905</time>, which led to the formation of a parliament and reforms. World War I brought devastating defeats and food shortages, leading to the overthrow of the <abbr title="Romanov">ROMANOV</abbr> dynasty in <time datetime="1917">1917</time> and the rise of the communists under <abbr title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir LENIN</abbr>.</p>

                <p>The brutal rule of <abbr title="Iosif Stalin">Iosif STALIN</abbr> (<time datetime="1928">1928</time>-<time datetime="1953">1953</time>) consolidated communist control at a huge human cost. After World War II, the <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr> expanded its influence in Eastern Europe and became a global superpower. During the Cold War (<time datetime="1947">1947</time>-<time datetime="1991">1991</time>), the <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr> was the main adversary of the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, but internal stagnation led to its dissolution in <time datetime="1991-12">December 1991</time> under <abbr title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail GORBACHEV</abbr>'s reforms of <abbr title="Openness">glasnost</abbr> and <abbr title="Restructuring">perestroika</abbr>.</p>

                <p>In the 1990s, Russia experienced turmoil under President <abbr title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris YELTSIN</abbr>, which paved the way for a more centralized, authoritarian state under President <abbr title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir PUTIN</abbr>. Putin’s regime focuses on geopolitical influence, managed elections, and economic growth based on commodities. In <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, causing sporadic conflict for the next eight years.</p>

                <p>On <time datetime="2022-02-24">24 February 2022</time>, Russia escalated the conflict by launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking the largest military attack on a European state since World War II. The invasion was condemned internationally, leading to sanctions and military aid for Ukraine. In September <time datetime="2022">2022</time>, Russia declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts, though these annexations remain unrecognized by the global community.</p>
