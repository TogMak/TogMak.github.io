                                I was a professional Tennis player until I was 20 years old.
                                I started playing Tennis when I was five years old and
                                played professional Tennis for three years (17 - 20 years old)
                                I played in the Turkish national team twice. Once in U-12
                                category and once in U-16. I later joined Wake Forest University
                                (WFU) to simultaneously play in the men's Tennis team
                                and pursue my education. I played there for two years.
                                I played in the starting lineup for doubles after the
                                first half of the first year and singles after the first year.
                                Tennis was not just part of my life, it was my life.

                                I got recruited in the Artificial Intelligence research team
                                by the head of the Computer Science department in Wake Forest
                                University while I was playing in the lineup for the men's
                                tennis team. My research project consisted of creating a
                                machine learning algorithm that would predict if certain
                                environmental chemicals caused "Thyroid Disruption".
                                My project took me 3.5 months to finish and was used
                                by students in the medicine school for their projects. I was awarded
                                with honors and gave a speech for the athletics department.

                                I did an internship in Paris in a startup company
                                specialized in SaaS (Software as a service). My internship
                                was rotational. I worked four weeks in the SaaS department
                                and four weeks in the sales department. I not only learned how
                                software works and actually did some myself but I also learned
                                how to do sales over the phone and in person. I had the advantage
                                of being able to speak three languages which really helped me
                                when I was in the sales department. I lived with my girlfriend
                                in a very small apartment. I made new friends and connections.
